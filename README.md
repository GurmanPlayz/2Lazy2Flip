# 2lazy2flip
heavily inspired by mindlesslydev's [NotEnoughCoins](https://github.com/mindlesslydev/NotEnoughCoins) mod  

features:
- checks for market manipulation
- category filters 
- name filters
- no sales checks (still can't figure out why certain items aren't in 3day.json)
- checks for updates 
- min profit and min percent profit
- webhook integration
- crating value market value prediction 
- nullify enchant values on select items
- goog enchant filter
- min lbin for rawCraft (to elimate stupid items like AOTD's with fumings getting on flips)

Credits:
